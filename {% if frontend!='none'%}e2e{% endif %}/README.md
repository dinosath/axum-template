# E2E Tests (Rust)

End-to-end tests using [playwright-rs](https://github.com/nicholasguan/playwright-rust) with docker-compose orchestration and [nextest setup scripts](https://nexte.st/docs/configuration/setup-scripts/).

## Prerequisites

- Docker with docker-compose (standalone) or docker compose (plugin)
- Rust toolchain
- [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/)
- curl and jq (for shell scripts)

## Install cargo-nextest

```bash
cargo install cargo-nextest
```

## Running Tests

```bash
cd e2e

# Run tests (setup script will start containers automatically)
cargo nextest run

# Run with verbose output
cargo nextest run --no-capture
```

After tests complete, run teardown manually:

```bash
./scripts/teardown.sh
```

> **Note:** Standard `cargo test` won't work because it doesn't support setup scripts.
> You must use `cargo nextest run`.

## Project Structure

```

├── .config/
│   └── nextest.toml      # Nextest configuration with setup scripts
├── scripts/
│   ├── setup.sh          # Setup script (starts containers)
│   └── teardown.sh       # Teardown script (stops containers)

```

## How it works

1. **Setup Script (`scripts/setup.sh`)**: 
   - Executed once before any tests run
   - Detects docker-compose or docker compose
   - Starts containers with `docker-compose up -d --build`
   - Waits for `/api/health` endpoint to be ready
   - Writes `E2E_BASE_URL` to nextest's environment file

2. **Tests**: 
   - Read `E2E_BASE_URL` from environment
   - Run Playwright browser tests against the running app

3. **Teardown Script (`scripts/teardown.sh`)**:
   - Run manually after tests complete
   - Runs `docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans`
   - Cleans up state file

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `E2E_BASE_URL` - Set by setup script, used by tests

### Nextest Configuration

See `.config/nextest.toml` for test runner settings:
- `experimental = ["setup-scripts"]` - Enable setup scripts feature
- Setup script: `start-containers` runs before tests
- Sequential test execution (1 thread)
- 120 second test timeout
- 300 second setup timeout

## Testcontainers

The tests use [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to manage Docker containers:

1. **Auto port mapping** - Containers use random available ports to avoid conflicts
2. **Health checks** - Waits for containers to be healthy before running tests
3. **Automatic cleanup** - Containers are removed after tests complete
4. **Parallel-safe** - Multiple test runs can execute simultaneously

## Test Reports

After running tests, view the HTML report:

```bash
npm run report
```
